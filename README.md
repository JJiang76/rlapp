# Red Lantern Android Application
---
Developed as a fun side project for my parents' restaurant Red Lantern.

An android application for viewing menu and other information for the restaurant developed with Android Studio (Java).

Used to support Firebase to store and retrive login information, though it probably does not work anymore.
